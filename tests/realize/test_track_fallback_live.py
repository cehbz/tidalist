"""Live integration proof: Trout Mask Replica assembles from individual tracks.

Captain Beefheart's *Trout Mask Replica* is absent on Tidal as a standalone album,
but many of its tracks appear on compilations.  resolve_album() should fall through
to _assemble_from_tracks(), yielding a partial set of PlatformItems and an
'album-source' Compromise rather than an empty (gap) result.

Artist spelling: MusicBrainz indexes this album under "Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band"
(not the shorter "Captain Beefheart").  The test tries the short form first; if that
returns no TMR result it falls back to the full band name.
