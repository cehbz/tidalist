"""Steve Winwood north-star end-to-end acceptance test.

Exercises the full offline pipeline:
    parse_intent → Curator.curate → realize → publish

Proves that a mixed album+track intent:
  - admits real album and track entries in order
  - excludes covers (PerformedBy per-candidate criterion)
  - excludes compilations (NotCompilation brief criterion)
  - realizes: albums expand to multiple tracks, tracks resolve to single items
  - publishes to a playlist reference
